# Telegram Bot for URL Shortening

This Telegram bot allows users to shorten URLs using the BM Links API directly from Telegram.

### Features
- Set your API key to shorten URLs.
- Shorten any URL directly from Telegram.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo

### Explanation:

- **Deploy Button Syntax**: `[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Tvshows122/Url-shortner)`
  - The image `[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)]` renders a Heroku deploy button.
  - The link `(https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Tvshows122/Url-shortner)` specifies where the button should direct users. Replace `yourusername/your-repo` with your actual GitHub repository path.
  
When users view your `README.md` on GitHub or in a Markdown viewer that supports rendering HTML, they will see a button labeled "Deploy to Heroku". Clicking this button will take them to Heroku's deployment page for your bot, where they can specify the app name and region before deploying.

Make sure your repository is set to public on GitHub if you want others to be able to access and deploy your bot using this button. This method effectively integrates deployment instructions and action directly within your project's documentation.
