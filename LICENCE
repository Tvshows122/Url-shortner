### Explanation:
- **Setup Instructions:** This section guides users through cloning the repository, setting up environment variables, deploying to Heroku using a deploy button, and running the bot locally with Docker.
- **Deployment Button:** The `[![Deploy...](...)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=...)` Markdown syntax creates a deploy button that links directly to your Heroku app deployment page. Users can click this button to initiate the deployment process.

Make sure to replace `yourusername/your-repo` with your actual GitHub repository path.

### Deployment Button Behavior:
- Clicking the deploy button will take the user to the Heroku dashboard where they can specify their app name and optionally change the region.
- After clicking `Deploy app`, Heroku will automatically clone your GitHub repository, set up the environment variables (based on your `.env` file), and deploy the bot using the specified Dockerfile (`heroku.yml` in your case).

This `README.md` provides clear instructions for setting up and deploying your Telegram bot for URL shortening, making it easy for developers to get started with your project.
